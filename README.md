## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server
- Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB+ recommended for production)
- Root or sudo access
- Minimum 20GB free disk space (SSD recommended)
- Domain name pointed to your server's IP

### Installation

1. **Prepare Your System**

   ```bash
   # Update system and install Git
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install -y git
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wagura-maurice/nextcloud-setup.git
   cd nextcloud-setup
   ```

3. **Run the Installation**

   ```bash
   # Make the script executable and run it
   chmod +x scripts/install-nextcloud.sh
   sudo ./scripts/install-nextcloud.sh
   ```

   The script will guide you through the installation process and automatically:

   - Install and configure all dependencies
   - Set up Apache with optimized settings
   - Configure PHP 8.4 with FPM
   - Secure the installation with Let's Encrypt SSL
   - Optimize Nextcloud for production use

4. **Access Your Nextcloud**
   After installation, access your Nextcloud instance at:
   ```
   https://data.amarissolutions.com
   ```
   Use the admin credentials provided during installation.

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Customizing the Installation

Edit the configuration file before running the installation:

```bash
nano configs/install-config.conf
```

### Available Configuration Options

- **Database Settings**: Configure MySQL/MariaDB credentials
- **Domain Configuration**: Set your domain name and SSL options
- **Performance Tuning**: Adjust PHP and Apache settings
- **Security Options**: Configure security headers and access controls

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- Automatic SSL certificate provisioning with Let's Encrypt
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, XSS Protection)
- PHP security optimizations
- Redis-based file locking and caching
- Regular security updates and maintenance scripts

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture: PHP-FPM with Apache

This deployment kit uses PHP 8.4 FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) with Apache's `mod_proxy_fcgi` module, which provides several advantages over traditional `mod_php`:

### Key Components

1. **Apache with `mod_proxy_fcgi`**

   - Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests
   - Serves static files directly
   - Proxies PHP requests to PHP-FPM via FastCGI

2. **PHP 8.4 FPM**

   - Runs as a separate service with its own process manager
   - Uses Unix domain sockets for communication
   - Configurable process management (pm = dynamic/ondemand)

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - OPcache with JIT compilation
   - Realpath caching
   - Optimized PHP-FPM process manager settings
   - Redis for session and file locking

### Benefits Over Traditional mod_php

1. **Better Resource Management**

   - PHP processes run independently of Apache threads
   - Memory is not tied to Apache processes
   - More efficient handling of concurrent requests

2. **Improved Security**

   - PHP runs as a separate user (www-data)
   - Better isolation between web server and PHP processes
   - Reduced attack surface compared to mod_php

3. **Enhanced Performance**

   - Lower memory usage per request
   - Better handling of high traffic loads
   - More stable under heavy load

4. **Flexibility**
   - Easier to scale PHP processes independently
   - Can run PHP on a different server if needed
   - Better support for modern PHP features

### Configuration Highlights

- PHP-FPM pool configuration optimized for Nextcloud
- Apache MPM Event with optimized settings
- Proper file permissions and security hardening
- Redis-based session and file locking

## üîÑ Background Tasks & Cron Configuration

Nextcloud requires regular background tasks for maintenance and optimal performance. This setup implements a robust solution using both systemd timers and traditional cron jobs.

### 1. Systemd Timer (Recommended)

- **Service**: `nextcloudcron.service`
- **Timer**: `nextcloudcron.timer`
- **Schedule**: Runs every 5 minutes
- **User**: Runs as root with proper permissions

Key Features:

- Automatic startup on system boot
- Proper process isolation
- Logging and monitoring via journald
- Automatic retry on failure

### 2. Traditional Cron Job

- **User**: www-data
- **Schedule**: `*/5 * * * *` (Every 5 minutes)
- **Command**: `php -f /var/www/nextcloud/cron.php`

### Verification

After installation, verify the cron setup with:

```bash
# Check systemd timer status
systemctl status nextcloudcron.timer

# Check when the timer will trigger next
systemctl list-timers | grep nextcloud

# View cron jobs for www-data
sudo -u www-data crontab -l
```

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

- **PHP 8.4 with OPcache and JIT**

  - OPcache with 256MB memory
  - Optimized realpath cache settings
  - JIT compilation for better performance

- **Caching Layers**

  - Redis for session handling
  - File locking via Redis
  - APCu for local caching (if available)

- **Web Server Optimizations**

  - HTTP/2 support
  - Brotli and Gzip compression
  - Proper cache headers for static assets

- **Database Optimizations**
  - InnoDB buffer pool configuration
  - Query cache settings
  - Connection pooling
